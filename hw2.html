<p>I chose the blurred glasses image due to the fact that I couldn’t stop singing a song in my head.
  That song is " End of Summer" by Tame Impala, and quite literally is but slowly starting to become the end of summer.
  I could visually see the mood of the photo, with that song playing in the back. This could be a stretch but the song has two voices in it: Tame’s voice as he’s singing and the high pitch voice when the song drops.
  So in the photo you can see two different views, the clear view of the background and the view through the lens of my glasses.
  You can see summer through both views, you see the green leaves and sunshine.
  As for the second photo, it’s some sort of illusion, everything is so close, yet so far.
  With that photo I can show perspective, and show two different dimensions. Not as size, but as in two literal places.
  Luckily in this photo, there is a distinct line in which these two "dimensions" are split, a vertical split.
  One side of the image is more flat than the other, and to me it looks 2D (two dimensional) and that side is the more close part, as mentioned.</p>

<p>As seen in the blurred glasses image, the compositional ideas I used to create visual interest was a literal frame.
  The image itself is a frame, and the glasses act as another frame, literally.
  By showing the difference between the frames, I kept the brightness almost the same but the contrast slightly higher,
  to see more of a sharper background and a blurry scene in the glasses. To bring attention to the glasses,
  it was cropped so it can be more centered. And so, to show the “End of Summer”, I played around with saturation & hues more towards red, green, and yellow.
  As they are some of the primary colors of summer and fall. As for the second image, it’s rotated, due to it being 5x7 in and with that the contrast was upped more.
  For the saturation, the yellow was close to max, to give off that summer feel. The vertical split has become a horizontal split, and seems more visible.
  The illusion is more shown with the yellow saturation. And for the top half, the cyan saturation was lowered and lightness was increased to a max,
  to show more of a gray, fading feeling. With that, I showed (my) a form of perception and perspective, and that being the end of summer.
