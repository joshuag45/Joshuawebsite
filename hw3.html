<h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<img src="blur3 copy.jpg" width="400px">
<img src="blurdid7 copy2.jpg" width="400px">
<p>The image is a simple photo of my water bottle, with a depth of field (blurred background).
  The original image, is the image on the left, and the biggest difference between the camera and my photoshop edits,
  is the warm lighting and the small awkward placement of the water bottle in the edited photo.
  Personally, Iâ€™m very impressed with how my edit came out. At first, I had a hard time remembering which one was the original,
  but the minor differences are seen. The process in creating my blur was clicking select, then subject.
  That fortunately selected my bottle and the stand it was on. Then, I inverted the select,
  so it selects the background and not my water and the stand. I had clicked Filter, then blur, and blur lens.
  I had increased the radius and everything in the background had blurred.

<h3>Part 2</h3>
<img src="C6 copy.jpg" width="400px">
<img src="bot1 copy.jpg" width="400px">
<p>For the exposure of the clock image and another image of my water bottle, I had dragged the .ARW images over the Photoshop app,
  and it had put me into Camera Raw. From there I was able to increase and decrease the exposure of both my .ARW images.
