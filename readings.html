<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>

<p>Susan Sotang, In Plato’s Cave from the book: On Photography, Sotang argues that the photograph is a misleading substitute for
  reality. The camera is the one who imprisons us in a world of appearances, blinding us from a world of truth.
  As stated by Sotang, "aesthetic consumerism.” Sontang reflects the camera as a tool for collecting, and capturing that moment,
  into a constructed history. Moreover, for me to capture images and create graphics, it’s to capture a story.
  As basic and broad as that sounds, it’s the truth. When you capture or take a photograph, it’s there to represent something,
  it’s there to stay till the end of time. One quote from Susan Sotang, In Plato’s Cave from the book: On Photography,
  “When we are afraid, we shoot. But when we are nostalgic, we take pictures.”
  To me that means, when you want to represent the past (or any certain event), you represent with emotion, as stated, “pathos.”
  Using photography as a form of nostalgia or emotion, can always show what existed and/or what is existing;
  using photography as a form of memorization & remebering, as stated, like a “memento mori.”
  Also, capturing photos back in a pre-digital era showed just how much more effort it took to capture a photograph
  (or a piece of history). Now capturing images is as easy as just sitting down, zooming in and tapping a screen.
</p>
<p>Back to reflecting on how I would use photography, and that being a method of a domino effect, or a form of representation (or symbolism).
  When considering the upcoming projects, I would visualize them as visual dominoes, where an image can spark a chain reaction of emotions.
  This would mean building some sort of a narrative, not with a single image, but a sequence of images where each one would push
  (or influence) the viewer towards a new perspective. A cliche example could be an image of a plastic bottle on a beach,
  representing the currents of the ocean, then it (somehow) connects to the vast amount of waste in the ocean.
  The domino effect is for the viewer to build a sort of visual argument, and in this case, the projects won’t just be a separate thing but a connected narrative.
  In relation to pathos, I would strive to also use that as a media maker. The viewer doesn’t just have to view, they can also feel.
  Make the image serve as some emotional trigger that can somehow resonate with the viewer.
</p>
<p>Representing our world, in the current moment, needs visual language that voices this merging of realities.
  I could use the combinations of image and text, photography to explore the enigma (or paradox) of connection and isolation.
  Our reality is an odd blend of the physical and the digital. It would use a combination of photography and illustration to show
  the tension between our digital and physical realities. Through photography, you could document one's physical presence.
  Then would be paired with graphic elements that would show the unseen digital world. In all, it’s to express the irony of being more connected than ever, and yet so very alone.

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>Defining AI slop is minimal human input, which allows for an “infinite number of fictional scenarios.”
  The author identifies this not as an entirely new phenomenon, but as an extension of traditional propaganda.
  What makes it dangerous is its distribution through private channels like WhatsApp, where the lack of comments leaves the content,
  “imbued with the authority and reliability of the person who has sent it.” This mechanism enables the rapid spread of misinformation,
  even among otherwise “online-savvy” individuals, even when the content “chimes with her political desires.”
  Which users are immersed in subjective worlds rather than objective reality is the direct outcome of this unchecked flow.
  Also, adding on to AI slop, is the unethical use of AI in the music industry.
  Many AI companies train their AI models without the consent of many musicians/users. Simply put, there is a lack of authorization and regulations.
</p>
<p>A crucial, more insidious dimension of AI slop is its ideological bias. Prof.
  Roland Meyer’s observation notes that “generative AI is structurally conservative, even nostalgic,”
  because AI is trained on pre-existing data, it usually concentrates on norms that are often biased against diversity and progressive values.
  This technical restraint manifests in the political aesthetic of AI slop, which the author describes as packaging,
  “…White supremacy, autocracy, and fetishisation of natural hierarchies in race and gender are packaged as nostalgia for an imagined past.”
  The “trad wife” content and the AI-generated images of  “…white, blond families” are visual signifiers of a non-existent golden age.
  It’s said that AI is “…the new aesthetic of fascism,” which is a plain warning that this technology is not merely a neutral tool,
  but one that currently reinforces regressive political and social ideologies, through intentional political fantasy.
  And as for AI music, you simply get the artist’s name, and write a prompt or write a whole bunch of random lyrics that have nothing to do with the artist.
  Though it requires ‘some’ thinking, it’s lazy, unfair to the real artists, and extremely unethical.
</p>
<p>If intentional ideological or merely “content-farming chaos” driven by the social media giants demand for,
  “…highly engaging content,” the accumulating effect of AI slop is “profound disorientation.” The constant stream of the nonsensical,
  the ideological, and the genuinely tragic, like footage of people burning in Gaza, blurs all visual categories.
  The result is a bizarre disorientation: “Everything starts to feel both too real and entirely unreal.”
  This collapse of visual distinction, combined with the “trivialisation and provocative brevity of the attention economy,”
  degrades real world crises into mere spectacle into “entertainment or, as an intermission, in a sort of visual elevator music.”
  The sense of urgency and call to action that global crises demand is blunted and paralyzed by this endless, overwhelming flow of information.
  We are “sleepwalking into disaster,” not because we lack knowledge, but because our capacity to process and distinguish.
