<h1>Homework 4: Photo Editing & Collage</h1>
<i><h3> Lost In Plastic</h3></i>
<img src="Lost In Plastic.jpg" width="300px">
<p>For this collage of images I chose a sky and sea image, image of pure trash, and small school of fish.
  The purpose of these three images is to represent the amount of trash just flowing through the sea & oceans.
  What I had done is set the blue sky and seas in the back, and cut out the sea. With the cut-out sea,
  I replaced it with the image of trash, to represent a sea of trash. Then, over it, is the small school of fish.
  The purpose of the fish is to represent what marine life has to go through on a daily basis.
  The amount of trash just flowing & floating in the sea, is enough to make multiple islands and probably a new country.
  And as someone who takes care of fish, it stings to see. It’s also just so dirty, dirty as in we could do better.
  It’s like “why is there so much garbage?”. And so, with the amazing assistance of Prof. Kelly, the image gained more traction; attention.
   Prof. Kelly showed me how to add texture over the image and how to remove/black out certain parts of an image, that part being the fish.
    Blacked out fish represents the death of sea life. The overlayed texture I went with was a clear, plastic fabric, to represent trash.
    Brightness/Contrast, Hue/Saturation, and a lot of Opacity for most layers were applied. That’s how <i>“Lost In Plastic”</i> came to be.</p>
  <i><h3> global WARMing</h3></i>
<img src="global WARMing.jpg" width="300px">
<p>The second collage and second ecological issue, I chose an image with hands with coal within the palms, image of the Earth,
  and an image of blazing fire. The obvious purpose of this collage was to represent global warming.
  The image of the fire was used as the background of the collage. Over it, I had put the image of the hands with coal,
  then I had cut out the white background, so the fire can show. Then of course, the image of the Earth will go above the hands.
  The Earth had been cut out from space and placed on top. The density had been raised to the max, to give the fire more of a realistic feeling,
  and the feather around the hands had been decreased to the lowest, to show the hands burning. Honestly, global warming is one of those topics
  everyone has to be informed on. It's sad to see four seasons become less and less, of what they truly are, as the years go by.
  We humans are the ones at fault for this extreme change of the planet. Burning through fossil fuels, and extreme use of power.
  And again, with the amazing assistance of Prof. Kelly, the collage came to life more. Prof. Kelly had assisted in giving the Earth
  more of a burn effect and showed me how to implement textures, and Prof. Kelly had implemented this old, burning paper texture,
  and smokey atmosphere. With adjustments in Hue/Saturation, and Brightness/Contrast, the image had become more “devilish” & “hell on earth.”
  That’s how <i>“global WARMing”</i> came to be.</p>
