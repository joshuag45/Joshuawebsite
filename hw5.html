<h1>Homework 5: Repeating Graphic</h1>
<i><h3> HANDS ON: GLOBAL WARMing</h3></i>
<img src="GLOBAL W.jpg" width="300px">
<p>The image is a continuation of <i>“global WARMing.”</i> What can be seen is these arms that sort of look like crab claws,
  and at the very end of the hand, it’s burnt. It’s supposed to represent just how hot the Earth is getting.
  The arms were created using two shapes: Rectangle and Circle. The rectangle was extended and made thinner,
  same for the circle but it was made into this crescent shape. I wanted to give the illusion that the arms are holding the Earth.
