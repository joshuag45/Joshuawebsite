<h1>Homework 5: Illustrator</h1>
<i><h3> HANDS ON: GLOBAL WARMing</h3></i>
<img src="GLOBAL W.jpg" width="300px">
<p>The image is a continuation of <i>“global WARMing.”</i> What can be seen is these arms that sort of look like crab claws,
  and at the very end of the hand, it’s burnt. It’s supposed to represent just how hot the Earth is getting.
  The arms were created using two shapes: Rectangle and Circle. The rectangle was extended and made thinner,
  same for the circle but it was made into this crescent shape. I wanted to give the illusion that the arms are holding the Earth.

  <i><h3> stressed.</h3></i>

<p>The eye went through many phases, but this came out best. So the complementary colors used were yellow and purple. The eye looks a bit like the Hunter Hawk.
  I wanted to use colors that had that same feeling to black and white. I thought it was going to be a bit simple at first,
  but these colors, AT FIRST, were hard to work with, but I made it work. I used different shades (and tones) of each color to give it more feeling.
  Those two colors by themselves, were not going to work. The veins are purple, like for most of the eye.
  The gradient is a mix of yellow and purple. Veins were definitely the harder part, simply due to the fact that every vein is an individual piece.
   The eyelid, the eye bags, eyebrow, and veins really give that feeling of stress, and emotion of being overwhelmed.
